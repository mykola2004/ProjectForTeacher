The task is to model number of invalids occurred during development of isolated tribe.
Let's consider the tribe development process, the focus will be on increasing of its population through time. 
The task is to simulate the amount of individuals with defected genes that appear during tribe development. 
The individual should be considered as having defected genes if his parents were relatives. 

Initial parameters could be:
1) number of individuals (females and males) in the tribe at the beginning;
2) maximum number of offspring that one individual can give during its lifetime(different for female and male);
3) probability that an individual will choose a mate from close relatives for one reproduction (an assumption is that male choose females, does not matter);
4) average age of one individual;
5) critical number of generations after which descendants of one branch cease to have common genes, i.e. are no longer considered relatives;
6) time parameter, representing period during which tribe development is investigated
